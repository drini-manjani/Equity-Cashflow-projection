Sharing a high‑level update and the near‑term deliverables for the 40‑fund test run. This is a pilot run using the inputs you provided and not a finalized production model.

Where we stand (high level)

The cashflow projection pipeline and NAV logic are integrated and operational in a test environment.
We can run a portfolio‑level projection using your inputs (grade, vintage year, signed amount/commitment, strategy).
We will assume vintage year = Q2 (mid‑year) when only the year is provided.
Planned outputs for this test run

P50 cashflows (expected path), broken down quarterly.
P95 downside case (5% worst‑case scenario).
Expected DPI in the 5% worst‑case scenario (downside DPI metric).
Portfolio‑level summaries plus fund‑level outputs.
Important caveats (please note)

This is a test run on a developing model.
The model is not yet finalized, fully tested, or validated.
Results are subject to significant model risk and execution risk, and should be used for preliminary insight only.
If this framing works, I will proceed with the secure run immediately and deliver results within the next two days.
